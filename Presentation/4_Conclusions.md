In this project we aimed to examine the relationship between social mediaâ€™s influence on large market share cryptocurrencies as well as any correlation between traditional stock market and cryptocurrency performance.

We found that social media mentions related most closely with the traditional stock market, not our expectation.

By far, Bitcoin had the highest comment counts within Reddit compared to the other Cryptocurrencies and the Stock Exchanges.
