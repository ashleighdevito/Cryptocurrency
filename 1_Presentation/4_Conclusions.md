In this project we aimed to examine the relationship between social mediaâ€™s influence on large market share cryptocurrencies as well as any correlation between traditional stock market and cryptocurrency performance.

What we found:

***
**Are there any trends in cryptocurrency performance related to social media mentions?** 
***

Social media mentions related most closely with the traditional stock market price fluctuations, not our expectation. There was a weak correlation between number of comments on Reddit and most cryptocurrency's values or volume.

**Limitations**
***
Our comparisons were performed using only one social media platform, Reddit.  There may be other platforms, or a collection, that has a graeter relationship with the markets.  
Also, these conclusions are drawn only within the bounds of this time frame.  Relationships may have varied before or since.
