In this project we aimed to examine the relationship between social mediaâ€™s influence on large market share cryptocurrencies as well as any correlation between traditional stock market and cryptocurrency performance.

What we found:

***
**Are there any trends in cryptocurrency performance related to social media mentions?** 
***

Social media mentions related most closely with the traditional stock market, not our expectation. There was a weak correlation between number of comments on Reddit and most cryptocurrency's values or volume.  

The correlation between number of Reddit comments to Dow Jones Volume over the time period of June 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020 is 0.7775. 
Between Reddit comments to Dow Jones Daily Price Range over the same period is 0.8208.

The general curve shape was similar. However, some platforms were far more volatile or were weighted by significanlty differing values.
